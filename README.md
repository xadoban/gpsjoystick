#GPSJoystick This module converts user-installed apps to system apps (systemlessly thru magisk, without modifying your /system partition). Now comes with companion App Systemizer application written by [@loserskater](https://github.com/loserskater), which lets you pick any user-installed app to be converted to a system app (reboot is required after you select apps to be systemized). THIS MODULE CANNOT BE INSTALLED FROM RECOVERY! Install from Magisk Manager only. Check [Support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3477512) for additional information. This module is GPS Joystick app (Ninjapps) - The app has been changed named and packages so can hide detection from Pok√©mon Go.
